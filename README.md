# User Auth

User Auth is a simple web application that provides user authentication functionality, allowing users to sign in and sign up securely. It also includes a feature to store user data in local storage, enabling a seamless log-in experience for returning users.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Users can create new accounts and log in securely(only when you are on website).
- **Persistent Data Storage:** If users choose to remain logged in, their data is stored for future logins.
- **Technologies:** The project utilizes Firebase for authentication and data storage, React Router for routing, and utilizes Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI, and Flowbite for a sleek and responsive user interface.
